# CFS.Avalonia.Controls

This is a small library collection of controls I've personally written for my apps to work with the Avalonia UI framework, including:

## `CFS.Avalonia.Controls.Image` 

A clone of the Avalonia's basic `Image` control that takes any `SixLabors.ImageSharp.Image` as a source and renders it properly, including support for animated formats like APNG, GIF, and WebP. 

## To be continued...

More controls to come in the future!
